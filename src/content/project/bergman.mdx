The Ingmar Bergman Foundation was established in 2002 to preserve and promote the legacy of the renowned Swedish film director, screenwriter, and playwright Ingmar Bergman. The foundation is responsible for managing Bergman’s extensive archive, which includes his scripts, personal letters, notes, photographs, and other significant documents related to his work in film, theater, and television.

By preserving Bergman’s archive and fostering dialogue around his work, the foundation aims to keep his artistic legacy alive for future generations of filmmakers, artists, and scholars.

## Role

As a Frontend Developer for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation project, I was responsible for implementing and enhancing the user interface of the foundation’s website. My focus was on creating a visually engaging and intuitive platform that effectively showcases the foundation’s rich archive of materials related to Ingmar Bergman’s life and work. I worked closely with designers and other developers to ensure the site was both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional for visitors exploring Bergman’s legacy.

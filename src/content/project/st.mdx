ST (Fackförbundet ST) is Sweden's largest union for government employees, representing individuals working within state administration, government agencies, universities, and public enterprises. With over 95,000 members, ST focuses on ensuring fair working conditions, job security, and professional development for public sector workers. It plays a key role in negotiating collective agreements that guarantee equitable salaries, work environments, and employee rights across Sweden’s public sector.

## Role

I was tasked with developing and implementing the user interface for st.org. Over the course of my work, I led a team of frontend developers, ensuring the creation of a responsive and intuitive digital experience for ST members.

Additionally, I held the role of Scrum Master, leading the team in an agile environment. This involved working closely with the Product Owner (PO) and Project Manager (PM) to maintain alignment with project goals and member needs, while ensuring that the team followed SCRUM principles for effective delivery. In parallel, I remained hands-on in frontend development, overseeing code quality and performance optimization.

Unionen is Swedenâ€™s largest trade union for white-collar workers in the private sector, with over 700,000 members. It serves professionals across diverse industries, including IT, finance, marketing, and engineering, offering support in salary negotiations, legal advice, career development, and job security. The union plays a critical role in securing collective agreements that ensure fair working conditions and advocating for employee rights, equal opportunities, and work-life balance. Unionen's mission is to empower employees to thrive in the workplace while protecting their professional interests.

## Role

As the Frontend Developer Lead on the Unionen project, I was responsible for shaping the user interface and overall experience of unionen.se. Over the course of four years, I led the frontend development team, ensuring that the platform delivered a seamless and intuitive experience for its users.

I also took on the role of Scrum Master, where I applied my SCRUM certification to lead the team in an agile environment. Collaborating closely with the Product Owner (PO) and Project Manager (PM), I facilitated sprints, managed team workflows, and ensured that we met key project milestones. This dual role allowed me to stay deeply involved in both team leadership and hands-on frontend development.
